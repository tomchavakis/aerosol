Aerosol Optical Depth Statistical Analysis

The purpose of this project is to observe the temporal and spatial variability of the aerosols over the southern Balkan Peninsula. 
The region of interest is confined between 19o and 29o E and between 34o and 42o N (fig. 1) and for the years 2007-2014. 
The aim will be to utilize the Moderate Resolution Imaging Spectroradiometer (MODIS) instrumentation on board Aqua, and CALIOP on board CALIPSO 
satellite in order to investigate the variation of Atmospheric Optical Depth (AOD).

<h3>Implementation</h3>

Development of a python code in order to perform the data reading, the calculation of means, deseasonalization and the plot.

Examples of plots:
